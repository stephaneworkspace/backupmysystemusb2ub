# This software is a part of backupmystemusb2usb and its functionality is to 
# backup one usb key to another usb with the same sapce disk
# Author: St√©phane Bressani <s.bressani@bluewin.ch>
#
# This is the config file. After the first operation this file is written and
# the UUID 1 Master and Slave is the same. (Because is a total copy of the usb
# key). A label with a timestamp is written to recognized the master and the
# slave.
#
# For get the info for the first time, write in your shell: "sudo blkid" 
# and find your two usb keys
#
# Be carfull, this is a total copy of the usb key. If your linux on usb key
# auto-boot is 128GB, the img file generated is 128GB. You may to have disk 
# free space in your Temp_img
#
# And don't forget to create path for variable Temp_img 
# (no need of touch the *.img or *.log)
#
# After the operation the img file is not deleted (for rescue security). But at
# the moment of execution of this program, this file is deleted.
#
# Kill_dd: True or False call "sudo killall -9 dd" for kill all processus dd
# Because, if you make a Ctrl + c in this long execution time of this program,
# sometimes dd continue to work in the background
